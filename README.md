### Instrucions

 Slot Machine - Piggy Parade
In 2019, we threw a casino-themed party for Alexandria's birthday. As an extra activity to the card games, I designed this slot machine as a replica of one we became hooked on during a trip to Shreveport.
I'm putting this out there as a resource since it's just been sitting on a hard drive in the closet, slowly deteriorating.

It is not balanced.
It is not original (although given what little I know about copyrighting game mechanics, you could probably change the logo/title and be totally fine).
And most of all - It's not going to work entirely out-of-the-box

Input
Since this was designed to be used in a standalone machine, the inputs are bound through Unity's input system. Rebind those however you need, but they worked great with a standard arcade USB encoder

Fund Tracking
The fund management for the night was done through a very simple API running on a separate machine.
